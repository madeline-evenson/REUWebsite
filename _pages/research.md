## Abstract

This study investigates the connections between the emission line spectra of galaxies and their morphological properties. We utilize recent JWST NIRSpec spectroscopic data in three bands to create emission line ratio diagrams. We examine two BPT diagrams showing the relationship between the $[OIII]\lambda 5007 / H\beta$ emission line ratio and the $[NII]\lambda 6584/H\alpha$ and $[SII]\lambda 6718 + 6731/H\alpha$ line ratios, respectively. We also examine two more emission line relationships: first, between the $[OIII]\lambda 5007/[OII]\lambda 3729$ and the $[SIII]\lambda 9531/[SII]\lambda 6717,6731$ emission line ratios, and the relationship between the $[OIII]\lambda 5007/[OII]\lambda 3729$ and the $[([OIII]\lambda 5007+[OII]\lambda 3729)/H\beta$ emission line ratios. We study the connections between these emission line ratios with several morphological properties: the effective radius $R_{eff}$, a measure of how compact/extended a galaxy we define as $\Delta log(R_{eff})$, each galaxy's S\'ersic index, and with the electron density of each galaxy. We find that there is a negative relationship between electron density and $\Delta log(R_{eff})$, along with a possible positive relationship between $\Delta log(R_{eff})$ and the S32 line ratio. 

## Introduction

A galaxy's spectrum is created by studying the galaxy's light after it has been dispersed into its component wavelengths. The emission lines present in a spectrum tell us incredible amounts of information about the physical processes within a galaxy, such as the rates of star formation within the galaxy, the galaxy's temperature and density, the amount and types of gas and dust in the galaxy, and more. Many of the strong lines we see in galaxy spectra come from HII regions, which are regions of space where hydrogen gas has been ionized by nearby stars. By taking flux ratios of emission line pairs close in wavelength, we can minimize the effects of dust extinction. 

The purpose of this study is to compare the results of these emission line diagnostics to morphological measurements of these galaxies. We examine the relationships between the aforementioned emission line ratios with several morphological properties: the effective radius $R_{eff}$, which is the radius of a galaxy that contains half of its light (M. Vika et al. 2015), a measure of how compact/extended a galaxy is, each galaxy's S\'ersic index, and with the electron density of each galaxy. 

The data used for this study was sourced from the Dawn James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Archive, which is a repository of public JWST galaxy data  (A. de Graaff et al. 2025) (K. E. Heintz et al. 2024). The spectroscopic data was gathered by JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec)  (P. Jakobsen et al. 2022) across three bands (G140, G235, G395).

## Methods

The morphology of each galaxy in the sample was analyzed using eight JWST images of the galaxy (A. de Graaff et al. 2025) (K. E. Heintz et al. 2024). From these images, the redshift $z$ and mass (measured in solar masses \(M_\odot\)) were measured. Profiles were then fit to galaxies using the pysersic code de (I. Pasha & T. B. Miller 2023). Throughout this process, each galaxy was assumed to follow a S\'ersic profile  (J. L. Sersic 1968). The S\'ersic index, a number representing the shape of the galaxy's light distribution, was then measured for each galaxy. Each of the eight JWST images measures slightly different $R_{eff}$ and S\'ersic index values, so these $R_{eff}$ and S\'ersic index values were then interpolated to the rest frame wavelength of $5000Ã…$ using SciPy's B-Spline interpolation software  (P. Virtanen et al. 2020). The observed size of galaxies correlates with both masses and redshift. This means that if we compare the galaxy size directly to the line ratio, it would be difficult to decipher whether any connections are due to differences in size or due to correlations with mass and redshift. To remove these confounding effects, a model was fit to describe the average size of a galaxy as a function of radius, mass, and redshift. 

To analyze the emission line spectra of each galaxy, each spectrum was moved into rest-frame wavelengths and had its continuum removed. An SNR-based Gaussian emission line fitting method line was utilized, and if the same emission line was detected across multiple bands, the band with the highest SNR was utilized. Several tests were performed in order to ensure the accuracy of this fitting method, including plotting the root-mean-squared of each galaxy spectra in each band and comparing the flux of the same emission line in the same galaxy across multiple bands. 

Four emission line ratio diagrams were created for this study, two of them being BPT diagrams (J. A. Baldwin et al. 1981). Although the original purpose of BPT diagrams were to find AGNs, now they are commonly used to investigate the properties of the gas within galaxies. The two BPT diagrams included in the study compared the $[OIII]\lambda 5007/H\beta$ emission line ratio to either the $[NII]\lambda 6584/H\alpha$ ratio (N2-BPT) or the $[SII]\lambda 6717 + 6731/H\alpha$ ratio (S2-BPT). The two other emission line ratio diagrams created for this study compared the $[OIII]\lambda 5007 / H\beta$ emission line ratio to each the $[SIII]\lambda 9531/[SII]\lambda 6717,6731$ and the $[([OIII]\lambda 5007+[OII]\lambda 3729)/H\beta$ emission line ratios (O32-R23). For the S32 and the O32-R23 diagrams, the emission lines in each ratio are much farther apart than in the N2-BPT and S2-BPT diagrams. This means that dust reddening effects are present in these diagrams, especially for the O32 and the S32 ratios. The PyNeb code was utilized to remove these dust reddening effects ects (V. Luridiana et al. 2015), and then these results were compared to similar plots from A. L. Strom et al. (2017) to verify their accuracy. The created N2- and S2-BPT diagrams can be seen in *Fig. 1.*, overlaid with known $[OIII]/H\beta$ relationships from A. L. Strom et al. (2017) overlaid as a comparison.

## Results

The first relationship we explored was between a galaxy's $\Delta log(R_{eff})$, meaning how extended/compact the galaxy is, and the emission line diagnostics. We began by recreating each emission line ratio diagram, coloring the data points blue if $\Delta log(R_{eff}) > 0$ and green if $\Delta log(R_{eff}) < 0$. These plots are seen in *Figure 2*. We did not find any significant difference in scatter between the different $\Delta log(R_{eff})$ values for any of these plots.

    points represent galaxies with $\Delta log(R_{eff}) > 0$, and green points represent galaxies with
    $\Delta log(R_{eff}) \leq 0$. We did not find any significant difference in scatter between these
    different $\Delta log(R_{eff})$ values for any of these plots.

We then moved to compare each separate emission line ratio with its distribution of $\Delta log(r_{eff})$ values. We utilized Spearman tests to determine the significance of each relationship. These plots can be seen in *Figure 3.*, and the results of these tests are summarized in \textit{Table 1.} The majority of these tests yielded insignificant results, with p-values ranging from 0.06-0.98. However, the Spearman test comparing the relationship between the S32 emission line and $\Delta log(r_{eff})$ yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.27, representing a positive relationship, and a p-value of 0.06, which is just on the cusp of what is generally accepted to be a "significant" p-value. Further study is needed to determine whether this correlation is statistically significant.

The second morphological feature we studied was each galaxy's S\'ersic index. As shown in *Figure 4.*, we plotted each individual line ratio against the distribution of each galaxy's mean optical S\'ersic index. We again utilized Spearman tests to determine the significance of each relationship, and a summary of these results can be seen in \textit{Table 1.} No relationships between the mean optical S\'ersic index and an emission line ratio were found to be significant.

    $log_{10}([([OIII]\lambda 5007+[OII]\lambda 3729)/H\beta)$.

The final morphological feature we examined was the electron density $n_e$ of each galaxy. We utilized the PyNeb software \citep{pyneb} to calculate the electron density, inputting the $[SII]6731/[SII]6717$ emission line ratio for each galaxy and assuming a fixed electron temperature of 10,000 Kelvin. We then created plots comparing the relationship between each galaxy's electron density and other morphological features, including the galaxy's mass, $\Delta log(R_{eff})$, and S\'ersic index. The plot showing electron density's relationship with $\Delta log(R_{eff})$ is shown in *Figure 5*. A table summarizing the results of these tests s shown in \textit{Table 2.}
